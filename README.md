## Why Builder.io?

Hardcoding layouts for frequently changing content bottlenecks your team and makes releases messy

Using an API-driven UI allows you to:

- Decouple page updates from deploys
- Schedule, a/b test, and personalize via APIs
- Reduce code + increase composability

## How is the content structured?

In Builder, content is structured in [models](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/guides/getting-started-with-models), and customized with [custom fields](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/custom-fields) and [targeting](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/guides/targeting-and-scheduling)

- **Builder pages** - full drag and drop control between your site's header and footer. [Try it out](https://builder.io/fiddle/fb98adf93ad5467180329fdaa9711f27)
- **Builder sections** - make a part of a page visually editable in Builder and use our [targeting and scheduling](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/guides/targeting-and-scheduling) to decide who sees what. [Try it out](https://builder.io/fiddle/81b6a689f6c74c82bbd982497cf08e34)
- **Builder data** - fetch structured data from Builder and use it anywhere in your application (e.g. menu items, structured pages). [Try it out](https://builder.io/fiddle/193e3e3128b84c80b1a9c4ba19612244)

See [here](#structuring-your-site) for examples on how to structure a site with Builder

## Getting started

**Requirements:**

- Node v14+
- Yarn

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

Remember to update `shopify.config.js` with your shop's domain and Storefront API token!

## Previewing a production build

To run a local preview of your Hydrogen app in an environment similar to Oxygen, build your Hydrogen app and then run `yarn preview`:

```bash
yarn build
yarn preview
```

## Building for production

```bash
yarn build
```

Then, you can run a local `server.js` using the production build with:

```bash
yarn serve
```

### Structuring your site

There are a lot of ways you can use Builder for your site. Some of the main questions you'll want to ask yourselves - what on your site should be in your code vs in Builder.

As a general rule, parts of your site that should be managed by non developers should probably be in Builder. Parts that are complex with a lot of code, should probably be in your codebase. Using [custom components](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/custom-react-components) in your Builder content can help you strike a good balance here as well

Here are some examples we recommend for how to structure various pages on your site, for instance for a headless commerce site:
